This project is a practical implementation of Hexagonal Architecture and Clean Architecture principles in a Node.js + TypeScript environment. It simulates a minimalist Twitter-like CLI application called "Network", built incrementally through Test-Driven Development (TDD).

Key features include:

Posting and reading user messages ("timeline")

Following other users and reading aggregated posts ("wall")

A modular and evolutive design to easily switch between CLI and HTTP API interfaces

The goal of this project is to learn how to build maintainable, testable, and scalable applications from scratch, one step at a time.
